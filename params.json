A detail-oriented Data Analyst professional. \r\n\r\nI recently completed the Master of Business Analytics from SCHULICH School of Business, York University and worked as a Data Analyst Intern at the Art Gallery of Ontario during the last eight months.\r\n\r\n* Adept at delivering financial and market intelligence by examining data repositories, generating periodic reports, data visualization and devising\r\nmethods for identifying data patterns/trends in information sources. \r\n* Highly proficient in establishing collaborative partnerships with customers, colleagues, and vendors to stay abreast of industry/business\r\ntrends. \r\n* Proven ability to learn and adapt as per business requirements and excel in face of adversity by overcoming obstacles. \r\n* Knowledgeable of analyzing competitive market strategies by evaluating related product, market, and share trends to synthesize current business intelligence data and provide recommendations for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\n.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
